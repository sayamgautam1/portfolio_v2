## Description

This is my second take on working on the portfolio, adding some of the projects i have done after making my first portfolio website.

# Purpose

To achieve the said task given<br />
AS AN employer<br />
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples<br />
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position<br />

# Features

When loded the portfoli you can see my resume with the sample of all my previous work.<br />
You are presented with my name, a recent photo, links to the sections inside the document, my work and how to contact me.<br />
When cliked on the links in the nav bar it scolls to the particular section.<br />
When clicked on a particular section the UI scrolls to the said section.<br />
When seeing any project/work the UI is bigger compared to other said project. <br />
When clicking on an application it takes you the said application. <br />
When resizing the media is responsive.
